# Product Segmentation and Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project analyzes transactional data to segment products, forecast sales, and provide cross-selling recommendations. The dataset includes transactional data for about 4000 products from Dec 2010 to Dec 2011. Returns are identified by invoice numbers prefixed with "C".

## Project Tasks
1. **Clustering Products:**
   - Use KMeans clustering to segment products.
   - Identify top contributors and slow-moving products.
   - Determine commonly grouped products based on sales patterns.

2. **Sales Forecasting:**
   - Use a Linear Regression model to predict future product sales.

3. **Cross-Selling:**
   - Recommend similar products for cross-selling based on clustering results.
